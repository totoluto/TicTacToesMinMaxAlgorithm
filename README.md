# tictactoesminimaxalgorithm

This is an Project which was made for a school project. I needed to choose an algorithm which I needed to implement into a Website. I chose the Minimax-Algorithm because i thought it was an intresting one.

## How does it work?

The Algorithm has all the possibilities of winning in a function called `calculateWinner` and he goes through the courrent gamefield and figures out if someone won.
It basically goes through every posibility and gives them a certain score. At the beginning every score is going to be 0 because you only have a few rounds played which couldn't lead to a win or lose decison. But after 3 plays the algorithm starts really working with those score values.

![Decison Tree Example](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a0c6978bff2001ef7581170/1513544600041-LK94ONS0M8TSFUFCPPNB/full-minimax-move-tree.png?format=1500w)

All the scores are at the end of a loop calculated together. The Algorithm is going to choose the path with the most posibilites of winning so he choses the path with the most or the last points depending if he's maximizing or minimizing. And after you played your turn he's going to repeat this scenario depending on the descion you chose.
So basically you are only able to lose or make a tie against the algorithm.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
